Description: HIBAG is a state of the art software package for imputing
        HLA types using SNP data, and it relies on a training set of
        HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be used by researchers with
        published parameter estimates instead of requiring access to
        large training sample datasets. It combines the concepts of
        attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier method, with
        haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging
        is a technique which improves the accuracy and stability of
        classifier ensembles using bootstrap aggregating and random
        variable selection.
